## Product Name: **PitchPerfect**

## Purpose and Overview

PitchPerfect is an AI-powered application that enables entrepreneurs and startup founders to generate professional-grade pitch decks efficiently. The tool uses generative AI to assist in crafting slide content, visual layout, branding, and even outreach. It is designed for speed, customization, and effectiveness—empowering founders to focus on storytelling rather than formatting.

PitchPerfect will feature a hybrid database architecture combining PostgreSQL with JSON support, ensuring both flexibility and structure. This makes it ideal for managing highly varied content like pitch decks, brand kits, and CRM data.

## **Purpose**

---

PitchPerfect is a cloud-based AI application that creates professional startup pitch decks automatically. Users input their business information during the “Discovery” stage, and the AI:

1. **Analyzes** the provided business details (text, files, brand assets).
2. **Crawls** the provided business website for additional context.
3. **Learns** the business profile (industry, target market, value proposition).
4. **Generates** a complete, branded pitch deck with minimal manual input.

## **Feature Requirements**

### **1. Discovery Stage – Business Learning AI**

**Goal:** Enable AI to fully understand the user’s business before deck creation.

**Workflow:**

- **Step 1:** User inputs:
    - Business name, description, industry.
    - Website URL.
    - Uploads files (business plan, product sheets, images, logos).
- **Step 2:** AI executes:
    - Text analysis on all provided info.
    - Web crawling (read-only) of provided URL to extract:
        - About page
        - Product/service pages
        - Team bios
        - Key metrics (if public)
    - Semantic summarization into structured business profile (JSON format).
- **Step 3:** Profile stored in DB, linked to Project.
- **Step 4:** Output preview for user review before pitch deck generation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- AI correctly stores structured JSON with fields:
    
    ```
    json
    CopyEdit
    {
      "business_name": "",
      "industry": "",
      "value_proposition": "",
      "target_market": "",
      "competitors": [],
      "key_metrics": {},
      "brand_tone": "",
      "unique_selling_points": []
    }
    
    ```
    
- Crawl only user-provided domains.
- Fail gracefully if crawl blocked (fall back to user-provided data).

- Output: Complete deck with:
    - Title slide

---

### **4. Database (PostgreSQL + JSONB)**

**Entities:**

- `users`

- `brands`
- `decks`
- `crm_contacts`
- `campaigns`
- `activity_log`

**Key Relations:**

- `users` 1—N `projects`
- `projects` N—M `decks`
- `projects` N—M `brands`
- `projects` N—M `campaigns`

---

### **5. APIs & Integrations**

- **AI Processing:** OpenAI API or Claude for text; Puppeteer or Playwright for crawling.
